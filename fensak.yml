# The config file specifies which rules should be applied to the different repositories in your organization.
#
# This contains a starting point for a fictional repo `my-repo` in your org. Update to point to your real repos and
# rules to get started using Fensak.
#
# Refer to https://github.com/fensak-io/fensak/blob/main/fskconfig/schema.json
# for the expected config schema.

  # to determine auto-approval for PRs in the repo.

    ruleFile: rules/sample.js

    # The following attribute is optional. When omitted, the rule language is automatically determined based on the rule
    # file extension. Refer to the schema for the list of allowed values here.
    # ruleLang: es6

    # The following attribute is optional. This setting controls how many reviews should be required for PRs where the
    # rule does not pass. The default is 1.
    # requiredApprovals: 1
